# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Live Market Data Transmission Component

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the software requirements for developing a component that will transmit live market data from MetaTrader 4 (MT4) using an Expert Advisor (EA) to an API endpoint. This data will be used for real-time analysis and further processing.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this document includes:
- Developing an Expert Advisor (EA) within MT4 to collect and transmit live market data.
- Creating API endpoints to receive this data in real time.
- Ensuring the system is scalable and capable of handling high-frequency data transmissions.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **MT4**: MetaTrader 4, a trading platform.
- **EA**: Expert Advisor, a program used in MT4 to automate trading.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface.
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This component will serve as the foundational module of a larger trading system that might involve machine learning in future iterations. Initially, it will focus on transmitting live market data from MT4 to a server via API endpoints for storage and analysis.

### 2.2 Product Features
- **Live Data Collection**: The EA will collect real-time bid and ask prices, along with other relevant market data from MT4.
- **Data Transmission**: This data will be sent to a specified API endpoint at regular intervals.
- **Error Handling**: The system will include mechanisms for retrying data transmission in case of failures.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **System Developers**: Responsible for maintaining the EA and API endpoints.
- **Traders**: Can use the transmitted data for real-time analysis or automated trading strategies.
- **Data Scientists (Future Scope)**: Might use the data for machine learning models and analysis.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The EA will run on the MetaTrader 4 platform.
- The API endpoints will be hosted on a server capable of handling high-frequency data transmissions.
- The system will operate in real time, requiring minimal latency.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Live Data Collection
- **Description**: The EA will collect live market data from MT4.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The EA shall collect bid and ask prices in real time.
  - The EA shall optionally collect additional data (e.g., volume, spread) based on user configuration.

### 3.2 Data Transmission
- **Description**: The EA will transmit the collected data to an API endpoint.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The EA shall transmit data every X seconds (configurable interval).
  - The EA shall use secure HTTP/HTTPS protocols for data transmission.
  - The EA shall include a retry mechanism in case of transmission failures.

### 3.3 Error Handling and Retries
- **Description**: The system will handle errors and retry data transmission as needed.
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - The EA shall log any transmission errors with error codes.
  - The EA shall attempt to retry the transmission up to Y times (configurable).

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 API Endpoints
- **Description**: Define the API endpoints that will be used to receive data from the EA.
- **Example Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/marketdata` - Endpoint for receiving live market data.
  
### 4.2 Communication Protocol
- **Description**: The EA will communicate with the API endpoint over HTTP or HTTPS.
- **Requirements**:
  - The API shall accept data in JSON format.
  - The API shall respond with status codes indicating success or failure.

## 5. Non-functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- The system shall handle up to X transmissions per second without significant delay.
- The API shall process incoming data and return a response within Y milliseconds.

### 5.2 Security Requirements
- The system shall use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- The API shall implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5.3 Reliability Requirements
- The system shall have an uptime of 99.9%.
- The system shall automatically retry data transmission in case of network failures.

## 6. System Architecture

### 6.1 Overview
- **Data Flow**: The EA collects data from MT4, transmits it to the API endpoint, and the data is stored for further analysis.
- **Components**:
  - MetaTrader 4 Platform with EA
  - API Gateway for receiving data
  - Backend Server for processing and storing data

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- **Data Transmission Accuracy**: The EA successfully transmits data at the specified intervals.
- **System Reliability**: The system meets the specified uptime and performance requirements.
- **Error Handling**: The EA correctly logs errors and retries transmission as required.

## 8. Appendices

- **Glossary**: Definitions of technical terms used in the document.
- **Diagrams**: Any necessary architecture or data flow diagrams.
